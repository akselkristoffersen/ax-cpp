# ax-cpp

Welcome to my **C++20 Header-Only Library**! This library was created as an outlet for my passion for templates, ranges, and metaprogramming techniques. It's lightweight, easy to integrate, and showcases the power of modern C++.

## Features

- **Header-only**: No need for separate compilation; just include the headers in your project.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and easy integration into existing projects.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akselkristoffersen/ax-cpp
2. Include the library in your project:

    Since the library is header-only, you just need to include the headers in your code. You can either copy the headers to your project or, if you're using CMake, add it as a subdirectory or via find_package.
